# ANN-2-layers

this is a MLP based on artificial intelligence concepts.
This ANN is configured to recognize 7-segment display to corresponding digit
To use, the first action is to train this neural network then to execute.
Change the input file to use a different problem with the cases to analyze the machine for every line
change the oracle file with the results corresponding the inputs
execute "main" program and digit "train"
when the train is finished digit "execute" and enjoy the process
